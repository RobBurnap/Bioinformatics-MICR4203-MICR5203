### About This Course
This site hosts interactive exercises, lecture notebooks, and supporting materials for  
**MICR 4203/5203 – Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics** at **Oklahoma State University**.

Students learn how to:
- Work with genomic and protein sequence databases  
- Perform sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and protein structure prediction  
- Explore gene expression and systems biology data  
- Apply bioinformatics to real biological questions

### Navigation
Use the left sidebar to browse modules in order:
1. **Foundations** – Getting started with data formats and tools  
2. **Sequence Alignment** – BLAST, MSA, substitution matrices  
3. **Phylogenetics** – Tree inference and evolutionary models  
4. **Genomics & Annotation** – Genome assembly, functional annotation  
5. **Gene Expression** – RNA-seq and clustering  
6. **Structure** – 3D models, AlphaFold, visualization  
7. **Systems Biology** – Metabolic models and network analysis  
8. **Machine Learning** – Feature extraction and prediction models  
9. **Applications** – Capstone exercises
